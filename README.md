# HTML+CSS
 This project is a demonstration of my HTML/CSS proficiency. I have used pure HTML and CSS to create a dynamic and responsive web page with various features. These features include CSS animation effects (such as transition and @keyframe), modal pop-ups, two-sided card flipping, hamburger menu toggling, and more. **I plan to improve this project further by making it fully responsive to different screen sizes and devices.**
